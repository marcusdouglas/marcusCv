    <h2>Personal Qualities</h2>
    <p>I was lucky enough to have the oppurtunity to perform in my secondary schools Steel Band where I learned that tea
        mwork and commitment are a vital part of ensuring that a consistent high standard is maintained as to what was e
        xpected from our audiences and what we expected of ourselves. I like to think of myself as an honest person whic
        h I hope proves evident through my provision of failed qualifications as well as my passes. I have a calm nature
        and sensible approach to situations which I feel is reflected by my secondary school awarding me with positions
        as both a prefect and a buddy.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Previously studied at Narin Academy, Nairn.</li>
        <li>Currently studying Bsc(Hons) Computer Science in first year.</li>
